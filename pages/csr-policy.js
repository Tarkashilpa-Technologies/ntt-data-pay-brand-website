            Committee will, in consultation with the trust / society / team
            carrying out the implementation of the CSR activity (the
            Implementing agency) decide about the time limit within which the
            CSR activity / project is to be completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Depending upon the time period for completion of the activity /
            project, the Board/CSR committee will decide upon the reporting
            frequency. For instance for shorter project / activity (say for one
            year or less) the reporting frequency may be quarterly or even
            monthly. For a project / activity of a medium duration (say for one
            to three years) the reporting frequency may be half yearly. The
            reporting frequency may be yearly for a project or activity of a
            longer duration (say three years or more). In case of a continuous
            CSR activity, the frequency of reporting shall be half yearly.
          </p>
          <p>
            - In case of contribution to certain funds, it may not be possible
            to insist on segregated reporting. In such a case, the reason shall
            be recorded by the Board/CSR Committee.
          </p>
          <p>
            - The implementing agency shall report the progress in the format
            annexed to CSR Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Wherever feasible, the Company shall depute one of the senior
            employees of the Company to make site visits, check the records of
            the Implementing agency or undertake any other due diligence
            activity to ensure the veracity of the information reported by the
            Implementing agency and / or generally to verify the progress of the
            CSR activities.
          </p>
